## About

This is both a topics and skills course.  The topics relate to determinants of
human well-being over the short and long-run, with a focus on the role of
environmental factors in shaping development outcomes.  The skills relate to
gaining facility with main methods that underlie quantitative research in the
environmental social sciences, including econometric concepts related to causal
inference, data wrangling skills, and data visualization.  Assignments and
class time will also be aimed at practicing critical components of the research
pipeline that are often not taught, including how to come up with a good
research question, how to effectively frame your research findings, and how to
make more compelling visualizations of your results.  Students will get the
most out of the course if they arrive with a working knowledge of R (or
comparable programming environment) and some previous exposure to econometric
methods or upper-level statistics related to causal inference. 


The course has the following learning goals:
 - Facility with many of the main methods that underlie quantitative work in
   the environmental social sciences, including: 
    - core concepts in the description and analysis of spatial data 
    - a working understanding of benchmark methods for causal inference in
      observational data and an ability to implement these methods in code and
      interpret and understand the results.
 - Algorithmic thinking: how to use computation to reason about a range of
   spatial and causal questions. 
 - Data visualization: learn how to design scientific visualizations that

## Assignments and grading
There are three things to complete each week: a "lab" (coding assignment)
focused on implementing in code the concepts we discuss in class, a single
reading, and a data visualization task. 

The course has weekly labs (10 total) focused on implementing in code the
concepts we discuss in class. These will be graded simply with ✔️ ➕ (perfect),
✔️ (median),  ✔️➖ (phoned it in), ⭕️  (didn’t do it). Folks can help each other
out on these but need to turn in their own work. 

For the first 5 weeks, the data visualization will consist of finding
a compelling online visualization to be shared in class. For the second five
weeks, the data visualization will relate to the reading assignment. In each
class, we will discuss these visualizations and then vote on the one we like
best. If your visualization is voted the best, you will bonus points. 
 
We will have an in-person final, and there will also be a class participation
grade, as we want to encourage active participation in class.

### Grading: 

{: .note }
> Grades don't matter (in our view), and we expect everyone is here
because they want to learn the material. If you try hard in the course, you
will do fine.  Nevertheless, we are obligated to assign grades.  

Here's how we will do it:

| Category            	| Points                	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------------:|
| Labs (10 total)     	| {✔️➕: 10, ✔️: 8, ✔️➖: 6} 	|
| Final Exam          	| 40                    	|
| Visualization tasks 	| 2 / per week          	|
| Class participation 	| 10                    	|
| Total points        	| 170                   	|


### Late day policy

To accommodate unforeseen challenges that may arise during the quarter, you
have three late days for the problem sets. Each late day allows you to turn in
an assignment up to 24 hours late. (Any fraction of a late day counts as one
late day.) You may use multiple late days on the same problem set. Work
submitted beyond the allowed late days will not receive credit.

Please note that we have provided the late day policy to help provide
flexibility to you in managing your course load during the quarter. If
circumstances arise that require further accommodations, we encourage you to
contact your academic advisor as well as the Office of Accessible Education
(see below) to help make appropriate arrangements. Out of fairness to all
students, in the absence of an OAE Academic Accommodation Letter, we will
generally be unable to provide accommodations beyond the late day policy above.

## Textbooks and readings
There are no official textbooks for the course. Each week will have one main
assigned reading, or a choice of one reading from a small set. 

## Software and Computation
The course will use the two programming environments at the core of modern data
science, statistics, and spatial data: python and R.  We are using both because
having fluency in both is core to being a capable researcher in these areas.
Both have advantages and disadvantages, and we want to equip you to be able to
take advantage of both languages. 

### Use of Large Language Models
We encourage use of LLMs as a learning aid. They are incredibly powerful in
this regard and should be part of all of our coding and learning workflow.
However, if you succeed in getting LLMs to do your homework for you, but do not
take the time to learn the underlying concepts yourself, you will be in trouble
on our in-class, paper-based final (for which LLMs will not be available). 

## Academic Accommodations

Stanford and our class are committed to providing equal educational
opportunities for disabled students. Disabled students are a valued and
essential part of the Stanford community. We welcome you to GEP 268

If you experience disability, please register with the Office of Accessible
Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate your needs, support
appropriate and reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Academic
Accommodation Letter for faculty. To get started, or to re-initiate services,
please visit [oae.stanford.edu](https://oae.stanford.edu).

If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, we invite you to share
your letter with us. Academic Accommodation Letters should be shared at the
earliest possible opportunity so we may partner with you and OAE to identify
any barriers to access and inclusion that might be encountered in your
experience of this course. Students who are immunocompromised should register
with the OAE as soon as possible.
