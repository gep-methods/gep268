## About

This course is part of a two-course sequence designed to bring students up to
the frontier on both topics and skills. The topics in the sequence relate to
determinants of human well-being over the short and long-run, with a focus on
the role of environmental factors in shaping development outcomes. The skills
relate to gaining facility with main types of data and methods that underlie
quantitative research in the environmental social sciences, including spatial
data analysis, econometric concepts related to causal inference, machine
learning concepts relevant to modern social science research, how physical
science models are integrated to social science research, data wrangling
skills, data visualization, and the design and assembly of a research paper.
Each of the two courses in the sequence is divided into two modules of five
classes focusing on specific topics (see diagram).

In the winter quarter (GEP 268), the first module focuses on the fundamental
elements of spatial data and how they are analysed – the goal of this module is
to learn how to “think spatially” about a variety of analytical problems. The
second module focuses on causal inference in a variety of policy and
environmental contexts, usually where spatial relationships play a central role
– the goal of this module is to learn to think scientifically about naturally
occurring variation in data.  Because these modules focus on core fundamentals,
there is a final exam at the end of the quarter to help students review and
solidify their mastery of the material.

The spring quarter (GEP 374) focuses on advanced topics that build directly on
tools and concepts developed in the winter quarter. The third module in the
sequence (the first five weeks of the spring quarter) focuses on a variety of
measurement challenges and tools used in frontier research, ranging from the
use of physical models and remote sensing tools to build data sets to
understanding the challenges of existing data collection systems. The fourth
module focuses on a variety of advanced topics in inference, ranging from
integrated assessment models and meta-analysis to the use of machine learning
for causal inference.

Overlaid on this topical agenda are assignments and material that will develop
two other skill sets within students across the two-course sequence. First,
students will learn to code in two widely-used modern languages used in
research: R and Python. Second, students will learn to develop the components
and structure of a research paper. We will not have the space to focus in depth
on writing the text of a research paper, but students will learn how to develop
data visualizations, effective presentations of analysis, and the design of
a paper’s architecture. Assignments and class time will also be aimed at
practicing critical components of the research pipeline that are often not
taught, including how to come up with a good research question, how to
effectively frame your research findings, and how to make more compelling
presentations of your results. Students will get the most out of the course if
they arrive with a working programming knowledge (preferably either R or
Python, or a comparable programming environment) and some previous exposure to
econometric methods or upper-level statistics related to causal inference. This
sequence is designed to complement and build on core classes on statistics and
causal inference, it is not a substitute for these courses.

The winter course (GEP 268) has the following specific learning goals:
 - Facility with many of the main methods that underlie quantitative work in
   the environmental social sciences, including:
    - core concepts in the description and analysis of spatial data
    - a working understanding of benchmark methods for causal inference in
      observational data and an ability to implement these methods in code and
      interpret and understand the results.
 - Algorithmic thinking: how to use computation to reason about a range of
   spatial and causal questions.
 - Data visualization: earn how to design scientific visualizations that help
 you and others understand and succinctly communicate relationships in data

#### How this course relates to spring quarter course
Spring quarter will be focused on writing an empirical paper that combines spatial
data with causal inference.  Building on topics and methods from the first quarter,
it will cover more advanced topics in causal inference,
with specific application to questions at the intersection of the environment and human development.
The goal will then be to deploy these methods in a quarter long empirical project,
where at the end you will have produced the building blocks of -- and gotten repeated
feedback on -- an empirical paper. These building blocks include an abstract,
a brief introduction, a methods section, and a set of figures that describe your
main results.

## Structure of the class

 1. Each week (Tuesday), there is a 3 hour mandatory class taught by faculty.
  - In these classes, the first 90 minutes of class will be “structured” presentation of material.
  - There will be a 10 minute break.
  - The last 80 minutes will be a mix of material and class discussion, pending module and instructor. Class discussion will focus on readings, which students should be prepared to discuss.
 2. At the end of class, assignments will be released. These assignments are due the following week at midnight before the next class.
 3. Each week (Friday: 8 - 10 AM) there is an optional section taught by the TA designed to support students and supplement the lecture.
 4. There will be a final exam during finals week.

## Assignments and grading
There are three things to complete each week: a "lab" (coding assignment)
focused on implementing in code the concepts we discuss in class, a single
reading, and a data visualization task.

The course has weekly labs (10 total) focused on implementing in code the
concepts we discuss in class. These will be graded simply with ✔️ ➕ (perfect),
✔️ (median),  ✔️➖ (phoned it in), ⭕️  (didn’t do it). Folks can help each other
out on these but need to turn in their own work.

For the first 5 weeks, the data visualization will consist of finding
a compelling online visualization to be shared in class. For the second five
weeks, the data visualization will relate to the reading assignment. In each
class, we will discuss these visualizations and then vote on the one we like
best. If your visualization is voted the best, you will bonus points.

We will have an in-person final, and there will also be a class participation
grade, as we want to encourage active participation in class.

### Grading:

{: .note }
> Grades don't matter (in our view), and we expect everyone is here
because they want to learn the material. If you try hard in the course, you
will do fine.  Nevertheless, we are obligated to assign grades.  

Here's how we will do it:

| Category            	| Points                	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------------:|
| Labs (10 total)     	| {✔️➕: 10, ✔️: 8, ✔️➖: 6} 	|
| Final Exam          	| 40                    	|
| Visualization tasks 	| 2 / per week          	|
| Class participation 	| 10                    	|
| Total points        	| 170                   	|


### Late day policy

To accommodate unforeseen challenges that may arise during the quarter, you
have *five* late days for the problem sets. Each late day allows you to turn in
an assignment up to 24 hours late. (Any fraction of a late day counts as one
late day.) You may use multiple late days on the same problem set. Work
submitted beyond the allowed late days will not receive credit.

Please note that we have provided the late day policy to help provide
flexibility to you in managing your course load during the quarter. If
circumstances arise that require further accommodations, we encourage you to
contact your academic advisor as well as the Office of Accessible Education
(see below) to help make appropriate arrangements. Out of fairness to all
students, in the absence of an OAE Academic Accommodation Letter, we will
generally be unable to provide accommodations beyond the late day policy above.

## Textbooks and readings
There are no official textbooks for the course. Each week will have one main
assigned reading, or a choice of one reading from a small set.

## Software and Computation
The course will use the two programming environments at the core of modern data
science, statistics, and spatial data: Python and R.  We are using both because
having fluency in both is core to being a capable researcher in these areas.
Both have advantages and disadvantages, and we want to equip you to be able to
take advantage of both languages.

## Class policies

#### Eating in class
Of course!

#### Laptops
Randomized trials have repeatedly shown that laptop use during class is
damaging to learning, both for the user and for nearby classmates. Therefore: laptop use is not
allowed during lecture unless we are doing a live-coding exercise that requires
laptop use. So, please bring a laptop to class but expect to mostly not use it.
Tablets are ok for taking notes, so long as you don't have any other apps open. The goal
is to save ourselves from our worst digital habits. 

#### Use of Large Language Models
We encourage use of LLMs as a learning aid. They are incredibly powerful in
this regard and should be part of all of our coding and learning workflow.
However, if you succeed in getting LLMs to do your homework for you, but do not
take the time to learn the underlying concepts yourself, you will be in trouble
on our in-class, paper-based final (for which LLMs will not be available).

## Academic Accommodations

Stanford and our class are committed to providing equal educational
opportunities for disabled students. Disabled students are a valued and
essential part of the Stanford community. We welcome you to GEP 268

If you experience disability, please register with the Office of Accessible
Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate your needs, support
appropriate and reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Academic
Accommodation Letter for faculty. To get started, or to re-initiate services,
please visit [oae.stanford.edu](https://oae.stanford.edu).

If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, we invite you to share
your letter with us. Academic Accommodation Letters should be shared at the
earliest possible opportunity so we may partner with you and OAE to identify
any barriers to access and inclusion that might be encountered in your
experience of this course. Students who are immunocompromised should register
with the OAE as soon as possible.
