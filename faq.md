### What are the class pre-requisites? 
We do not have a strong list of pre-requisites. We expect students are
familiarized with multivariable calculus and Linear Algebra to the MATH51
level. Basic level of Statistics and Probability theory is not needed, but is
helpful (see STATS 202 or CS109). Any proof based class won't be necessary, 
but can help you deepen your understanding of the class contents. 

### Are sections mandatory? 
They're not, but they are a good resource to learn additional content related
to the labs and a way to ask questions you couldn't ask during the main
session. 

### I didn't turn in a Lab/Viz in time. Can I have an extension? 
You have 5 late days you can use throughout the quarter. You can use these days
for either a lab or a data visualization assignment. Any additional late day
after the allowed one will incur in a grade penalization. 

### What should I do if I have further questions? 
Write a hidden message on Ed so any of the course staff can address your
question or ask your classmates.
