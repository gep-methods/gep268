## How to run and execute the labs

The starter code for each assignment will be shared after class each Tuesday. You can run the labs locally on your own machine by following the instructions: 


{: .warning}


### Run notebook locally

1. Download and unzip the `.zip` file and modify the contents. Make sure the notebooks (`.ipynb`) and the `data` folder are all uncompressed.

2. Work on your problem set  💪⚙️⚡💯📈

3. Once you're done, and if you're running things locally, just go to your terminal and run: 

{: .note}
Before running this script, make sure you have installed a Tex Live distribution. You can follow the instructions [here][1] for MacOS, or as discussed in the [tutorial](./software/python.md), you can run `brew install texlive`. 

```bash
./prepare_submission.sh
```

4. Upload both the `lab_x_code_submission.zip` file and the `lab_x_submission.pdf` to Gradescope


### Run notebooks in GoogleColab

1. Download and unzip the `.zip` file. 

2. Upload the uncompressed folder `lab_1` to your Google Drive. To make your life easier, is recommendable to create a folder in your Drive called `GEP268` to add all your labs. Make sure
to use your SUNet ID to log into Google Drive.
