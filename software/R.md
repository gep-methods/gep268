# R Statistical Language

R is a widely programming language used mainly in Econometrics and Statistics.
R has a very robust ecosystem of libraries which makes it very powerful for
many different tasks. R is a very powerful language and very unique when it
comes to statistics. Here we will discuss how to install and run R using
RStudio, an *Integrated Development Environment* designed exclusively for R (it
can also run Python, but they should stay on their lane). 

{: .note }
A piece of trivia, R is based in S, an old high-level statistical language
created by Bell Labs. The main developer of S is [John Chambers][2], a professor at
Stanford. Prof. Chambers changed statistics and computation forever, and he's
very humble about his impact. Learn more about him [here][1]. 

## Installing R

Compared to Python R installations are easier. You can either use brew as in the Python section: 

```bash
brew install --cask R rstudio
```

Or alternatively manually install [R][3] and [RStudio][4]. For Windows, you can
find the corresponding software on these links too!

## R environments

The concept of virtual environments is also present in R. Compared to python
where there are many options. R has a simple library to manage and share
environments: [`revn`][5]. Once you install R, you can open your terminal and
execute `R`: 

```bash
$ R
R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31) -- "Pile of Leaves"
Copyright (C) 2024 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin24.1.0

R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.

  Natural language support but running in an English locale

R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
Type 'contributors()' for more information and
'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

```

The `>` indicates that you're in R world and that any text you type will be run on the 
R interpreter. Now, to install `renv`, use the `install.packages` function: 

```R
install.packages(c("renv", "pacman"), repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```

If you omit the `repos` option, a list of options will open: 

```
--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---
Secure CRAN mirrors

 1: 0-Cloud [https]
 2: Australia (Canberra) [https]
 3: Australia (Melbourne 1) [https]
 ...
```

You can select your favorite number or any number from 66 to 74 to select an American server (USA! USA! USA! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸) 

Here we are using a vector of strings to tell R to install two packages, `revn`
and `pacman`, a nice package that we will discuss later.





{: .warning }
While `reticulate` allows R to run Python, we highly discourage that integration.
